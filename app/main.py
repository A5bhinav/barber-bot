#This is the start of a bot that will take instagram comments for a barber and then respond to them. 
#It will use the Instagram Graph API to fetch comments and respond accordingly.
#It will also use OpenAI's GPT-3.5 to generate responses based on the comments.
#It will take the comments and have a conversation with them about when the best time to come in for a haircut is.
#The bot will ask the user to confirm the time slot, and then send a confirmation message, as well as marking the time slot as booked in a local database.


#This is where the webhooks will go to receive comments from Instagram
